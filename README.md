## Usage

### Log a Sighting

```bash
# Basic usage
python -m birdwatch.cli log "American Robin"

# With all options
python -m birdwatch.cli log "American Robin" --location "Central Park" --count 2 --notes "Singing in tree"
```

### List Sightings

```bash
# List all sightings
python -m birdwatch.cli list

# Filter by species
python -m birdwatch.cli list --species "American Robin"

# Filter by location
python -m birdwatch.cli list --location "Central Park"

# Filter by both species and location
python -m birdwatch.cli list --species "American Robin" --location "Central Park"
```

```bash

python -m birdwatch.cli export

# Export with custom filename
python -m birdwatch.cli export --filename my_sightings.csv
```

## Data Storage

Sightings are stored in a local JSON file (`sightings.json`). The CSV export feature allows you to export your data in a format suitable for spreadsheet applications or data analysis.

## Contributing

This is just a fun little project I built for myself! If you're the kind of person who's interested in logging bird sightings with this level of detail, I have a feeling you're already on eBird or would have a much better time there. (But if you feel a burning desire to contribute, hey, feel free to reach out!)
